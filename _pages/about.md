I am currently a Science II at [Pros Inc](https://pros.com/). I earned my Ph.D. in [Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu/) from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Dr. Meng Li](http://meng.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Marina Vannucci](http://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). Before attending Rice, I obtained a Master's degree in [Economics](https://econ.duke.edu/) from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), where I developed my interests in Bayesian Statistics, leading me to pursue a Ph.D. in the subject.

While my primary research interest is in developing Bayesian statistical models for complex problems and applications, I am also deeply interested in other methodologies. I firmly believe that interdisciplinary studies frequently serve as a catalyst for groundbreaking ideas. My research spans a range of areas including Bayesian modeling, variable selection, machine learning, and functional data analysis. I apply these techniques to various applications, including time-series forecasting, image analysis, clinical care and revenue management.

I am enthusiastically engaged in tracking the latest developments in methodologies. I've had the pleasure of reviewing papers for the Artificial Intelligence and Statistics Conference (AISTATS), NeurIPS Workshop on Deep Generative Models for Health (DGM4H), Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI), and Bayesian Analysis. If you're in need of a reviewer for similar conferences or journals, please feel free to contact me via email.
