I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Meng Li](http://meng.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Marina Vannucci](http://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). Before Rice, I was a Master student in Economics at Duke university, where I found my interests in Bayesian Statistics and decided to continue pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics.

I am generally interested in the development of Bayesian statistical models for complex problems and applications.
