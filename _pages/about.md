I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Meng Li](http://meng.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Marina Vannucci](http://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). Before Rice, I was a Master student in Economics at Duke university, where I found my interests in Bayesian Statistics and decided to continue pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics.

I am generally interested in the development of Bayesian statistical models for complex problems and applications. I am also open to the other methodologies as I believe interdisciplinary studies can often inspire great new ideas. My research includes Bayesian modeling, variable selection, nonparametric Bayes, quantile regression, functional data analysis and machine learning on different data sets such as economic time-series, image data and gene expression data.

I am also interested in following the latest results in Bayesian statistics. I had some joyful experience helping review papers for Artificial Intelligence and Statistics Conference (AISTATS), Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) and Bayesian Analysis. Please feel free to email me if you need reviewer for either conference or journal on Bayesian materials.
