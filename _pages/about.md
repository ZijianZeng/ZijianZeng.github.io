I am a Ph.D. in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), co-advised by [Dr. Meng Li](http://meng.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Marina Vannucci](http://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). Prior to joining Rice, I earned a Master's degree in Economics from Duke University, where I found my interests in Bayesian Statistics and decided to continue pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics.

While my research interests lie primarily in the development of Bayesian statistical models for complex problems and applications, I am also open to the other methodologies. I believe that interdisciplinary studies can often inspire great new ideas. My research includes Bayesian modeling, variable selection, nonparametric Bayes, quantile regression, functional data analysis and machine learning on different types of datasets including economic time-series, image data and gene expression data.

I am also passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest results in Bayesian statistics. I have had the pleasure of reviewing papers for Artificial Intelligence and Statistics Conference (AISTATS), Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) and Bayesian Analysis. Please feel free to email me if you need a reviewer for a conference or journal on Bayesian materials.
