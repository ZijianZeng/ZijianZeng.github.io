I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Meng Li](http://meng.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Marina Vannucci](http://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). Before Rice, I was a Master student in Economics at Duke university, where I found my interests in Bayesian Statistics and decided to continue pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics.

I am generally interested in the development of Bayesian statistical models for complex problems and applications. I am also open to the other methodologies as I believe interdisciplinary studies can often inspire great new ideas. My research includes Bayesian modeling, variable selection, nonparametric Bayes, quantile regression, functional data analysis and machine learning on different data sets such as economic time-series, image data and gene expression data.
